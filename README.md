# Computer-Graphics
some of the labs and projects i did in computer graphics class
so, to find the code i did in this you must open in visual studio via clicking project name-> project name -> visualc14 -> glutapp3d 
then once the project loads you need to look at the myapp section and all but the app_main.cpp in that section should be made by me.
i think the only exception should be when we made a shader, however for the most part the code was given to us for that one.
